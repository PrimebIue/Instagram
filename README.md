## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

This app was pretty fun to make, this time I completed most of the optional user stories and I am pretty happy with the end result. I finally was able to understand fragments properly and implemented them nicely in the app. The main challenge of this assignment was understanding how to use Parse, it was a completely new concept and I was able to understand it thanks to Codepath's documentation and some extra help from stackoverflow. During this assignment I never really got stuck other than when trying to allow the user to upload a profile picture from the phone's gallery, this took some reasearch in Google and I ended up adapting a random code I found online to my needs, I ended up getting a URI from the gallery, then transforming it to an array of bytes using a function I found online and finally transforming it again into a Parse File. Overall it was a fun assignment.
